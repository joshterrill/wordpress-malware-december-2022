# Wordpress Malware (December 2022)

This repo contains files from some malware that infected PHP-based websites (specifically Wordpress websites) in Dcember 2022.

All files that have `.infected` in the filename were retrieved from an infected server in their natural state. Files with `.reversed` are files that I've begun reverse engineering and only contain code pertaining to the malware.

The command and control servers appears to be the following:

* `http://3829-ch4-v26.zxckid.com`
* `https://c.wiv3.com`
* `https://c.oiv3.com`
* `http://51la.izv3.com/a.txt` <-- appears to show nothing on the page, but using view source you can see that PHP code is being sent in the response
* `http://51la.izv3.com/?d=<base64 encoded request object>`
* `http://c.jkv2.com/1`
* `http://3843-ch4-v22.freeykc.com/`
