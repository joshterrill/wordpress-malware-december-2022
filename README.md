# Wordpress Malware (December 2022)

This repo contains files from some malware that infected PHP-based websites (specifically Wordpress websites).

All files that have the `.infected` appended on the end are the files retrieved from an infected server in their natural state. Files with `.reversed` are files that I've begun reverse engineering.

The command and control server appears to be: `http://3829-ch4-v26.zxckid.com`

And thorough write up will be coming soon.
