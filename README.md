# Wordpress Malware (December 2022)

This repo contains files from some malware that infected PHP-based websites (specifically Wordpress websites) in Dcember 2022.

All files that have `.infected` in the filename were retrieved from an infected server in their natural state. Files with `.reversed` are files that I've begun reverse engineering and only contain code pertaining to the malware.

The command and control servers appears to be the following:

* `http://3829-ch4-v26.zxckid.com`
* `https://c.wiv3.com`
* `https://c.oiv3.com`
* `http://51la.izv3.com/a.txt` <-- appears to show nothing on the page, but using view source you can see that PHP code is being sent in the response

A virus-total collection for these documents can be found here: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/collection/9b8304f062e3ce294a50deb00512a8c40dc3cd24f9256c1c65ffc73f59adddbc 

And a thorough writeup will come soon.
